Here is my submission for PSY1210 project 1. To run the task, open the MT Runner software from the MouseTracker 
package, select ES2A or ES2A shortened, and enter a participant number. To end the task early, press F12. 

The task should proceed as follows:
1. The first set of instructions is displayed.
2. An image of a face with some accompanying information appears.
3. The second set of instructions is displayed.
4. A series of forced choice (YES/NO) mouse-tracking task trials are run. There should be 18 trials in ES2A, or
only 4 trials in ES2A shortened; the tasks are otherwise identical. 
5. An end screen with a 'thank you message' appears. 

Note that, because MouseTracker does not have a function for randomly choosing a single stimulus from a set of 
possible stimuli, I have created 4 total versions of this task for the different combinations of masculine versus
feminine interests and male versus female partner, along with a predetermined participant randomization 
spreadsheet. The alternate versions of the task are identical to ES2A, save for displaying a different image in
the second stage of the task.
